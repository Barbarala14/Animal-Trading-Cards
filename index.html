			<p>The beluga whale (<em>Delphinapterus leucas</em>) is an Arctic and sub-Arctic cetacean. 
                It is one of two members of the family Monodontidae, along with the narwhal, and the only member of the genus Delphinapterus. 
                The beluga got the name of sea canary due to its high-pitched calls; 
                and the melonhead, though that more commonly refers to the melon-headed whale, which is an oceanic dolphin.
